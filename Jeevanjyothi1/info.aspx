                            A blood donation is when a healthy person voluntarily has blood drawn. The blood is used for transfusions or made into medications by a process called fractionation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who give blood for a community supply. In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion. Many donors donate as an act of charity, but some are paid and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. A donor can also have blood drawn for their own future use. Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.
                        </p><p>
                            Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor is also asked about medical history and given a short physical examination to make sure that the donation is not hazardous to their health. How often a donor can give varies from days to months based on what they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place.
                        </p><p>
                            The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary, but a typical donation is 500 milliliters of whole blood. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that only takes specific portions of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem.

                            Blood donations are divided into three groups based on who will receive the collected blood. An allogeneic (also called homologous) donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a blood bank for transfusion to an unknown recipient. A directed or replacement donor donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for transfusion to a specific individual. Directed donations are rare in developed countries like Canada but are common in developing countries such as Ghana. The third kind is when a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery. This is called an autologous donation. Blood that is used to make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The actual process varies according to the laws of the country, and recommendations to donors vary according to the collecting organization. The World Health Organization gives recommendations for blood donation policies, but in developing countries many of these are not followed. For example, the recommended testing requires laboratory facilities, trained staff, and specialized reagents, all of which may not be available or too expensive in developing countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            An event where donors come to give allogeneic blood is sometimes called a blood drive or a blood donor session. These can occur at a blood bank but they are often set up at a location in the community such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.

                            Blood is the living fluid that all life is based on. Blood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc. But the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Saving a life does not require heroic deeds. You could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort for saying "yes".

                            Every 2 seconds someone needs blood. Your blood helps more than one life at a time. Accidents, premature babies, major surgeries require Whole blood, where your blood after testing is used directly. Trauma, Anemia, other surgeries requires only RBC, which is separated from your blood. The procedure of splitting blood components is called Cytapheresis. Similarly Platelets are used for Cancer patients undergoing Chemotherapy, Dengue fever, etc. Fresh frozen plasma is used for patients having massive Transfusions, Plasma is used for Burns and Cryoprecipitate is used for Hemophilia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When is blood needed? Blood is needed at regular intervals and at all times as it has only a finite time to store. Red blood cells can be stored for about 42 days, Fresh Frozen Plasma and Cryoprecipitate for a year and platelets for 5 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Who can donate blood? Anyone above 18 years weighing more than 50kgs (110 lbs) can donate blood. At the time of donation, you should not be suffering from fever or had consumed alcohol 48 hours before or smoked during that day.

                            Blood is grouped into four types: <b>A, B, AB, and O.</b><br />
                            Each Type is also classified by an Rh factor: Either positive (+) or negative (-).

                        <p>
                            When a blood transfusion is necessary, donor and patient blood must be compatible. If not, the patient's body will react to the incompatible donor cells, leading to complications, maybe even death. Your ABO blood grouping and Rh factor are inherited from your parents.
                        </p>
                        Following are the Blood Groups
                        <ul>
                            <li>O Positive</li>

                            <li>A Positive</li>
                            <li>A Negative</li>
                            <li>B Positive</li>
                            <li>B Negative</li>
                            <li>AB Positive</li>
                            <li>AB Negative</li>

                        <p><b>Blood Group O (Universal Donor)</b></p>
                        <b>O Negative</b>
                        <p>
                            As an O negative donor, we have a great need for your whole blood donations. This type is uncommon – only 6 percent of the population is O negative. O negative patients should receive blood only from O negative donors.
                            People with every other blood type can safely be transfused with O negative blood. This is usually done in an extreme emergency, before their own blood types can be determined.
                        </p>
                        <b>O Positive</b>
                        <p>
                            As an O positive whole donor, it is of great help in donation. This type is the most common - nearly 40 percent of the population is O positive. It is in greatest demand.

                        <p>
                            Before donating blood some basic information such as your name, address and age is recorded. A medical checkup is done, where your pulse, blood pressure and temperature is also checked. Blood is analyzed for hemoglobin content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The procedure is done by a skilled, specially trained technician and takes seven to ten minutes. There may be a little sting when the needle is inserted, but there should be no pain during the donation. The materials, including the needle used for your donation, should be new, sterile, disposable and used only once by you for your blood donation.
                        </p>
                        <p>You should rest a bit after the donation and have some refreshments.</p>

                        <p><b>After Donating Blood</b></p>
                        <p>
                            You can resume full activity as long as you feel well. Just avoid lifting, pushing or picking up heavy objects for at least four or five hours after giving blood. After donating, drink lots of fluids for the next 48 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your body replaces blood volume or plasma within 24 hours. Red cells need about four to eight weeks for complete replacement. You can donate whole blood every 90 days and you can also donate specific life–saving blood components besides whole blood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After donation, your blood will be tested for blood type, hepatitis, HIV (the AIDS virus), HTLV (Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus), and Syphilis. Then it can be used either as whole blood for one patient or, after separation into components, to help several patients.
                        </p>

                        <b>What is the swine flu?</b>

                        <p>The swine influenza A (H1N1) virus that has infected humans in the U.S. and Mexico is a novel influenza A virus that has not previously been identified in North America. This virus is resistant to the antiviral medications amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine), but is sensitive to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). Investigations of these cases suggest that on-going human-to-human swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is occurring.</p>

                        <b>What are the symptoms of swine flu?</b>

                        <p>Although uncomplicated influenza-like illness (fever, cough or sore throat) has been reported in many cases, mild respiratory illness (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea) without fever and occasional severe disease also has been reported. Other symptoms reported with swine influenza A virus infection include vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, headache, chills, fatigue, and dyspnea. Conjunctivitis is rare, but has been reported. Severe disease (pneumonia, respiratory failure) and fatal outcomes have been reported with swine influenza A virus infection. The potential for exacerbation of underlying chronic medical conditions or invasive bacterial infection with swine influenza A virus infection should be considered.</p>

                        <b>How can swine (H1N1) flu be prevented?</b>

                        <p>The best way to prevent swine flu would be the same best way to prevent other influenza infections, and that is vaccination. When a safe vaccine is developed (projected to happen in a few months), people should get vaccinated if the disease is still causing infections. The CDC says that a good way to prevent any flu disease is to avoid exposure to the virus; this is done by frequent hand washing, not touching your hands to your face (especially the nose and mouth), and avoiding any close proximity to or touching any person that may have flu symptoms. Since the virus can remain viable and infectious for about 48 hours on many surfaces, good hygiene and cleaning with soap and water or alcohol-based hand disinfectants are also recommended. Some physicians say face masks may help prevent getting airborne flu viruses (for example, from a cough or sneeze), but others think the better use for masks would be on those people who have symptoms and sneeze or cough. The use of Tamiflu or Relenza may help prevent the flu if taken before symptoms develop or reduce symptoms if taken within about 48 hours after symptoms develop. However, taking these drugs is not routinely recommended for prevention because investigators suggest that as occurs with most drugs, flu strains will develop resistance to these medications. Your doctor should be consulted before these drugs are prescribed.</p>

                        <p>In general, preventive measures to prevent the spread of flu are often undertaken by those people who have symptoms. Symptomatic people should stay at home, avoid crowds, and take off from work or school until the disease improves or medical help is sought. Sneezing, coughing, and nasal secretions need to be kept away from other people; simply using tissues and disposing of them will help others. Quarantining patients is usually not warranted, but such measures depend on the severity of the disease.</p>

                        <b>♦ What is it ?</b>
                        <p>Dengue fever is a common communicable disease characterized by occurrence of high fever, severe body aches and intense headache. It is a very common disease that occurs in epidemic form from time to time. Delhi and parts of North India experienced a large number of cases of Dengue in 1996, 2003 and 2006. The disease is quite severe in young children as compared to adults.</p>
                        <p>It is a disease which occurs throughout the world except in Europe and affects a large number of people. For example, it is estimated that every year, 2 crore cases of Dengue fever occur in the world. Death rate varies from 5 per 100 cases to 30 per 100 cases.</p>

                        <b>♦ Cause ?</b>
                        <p>It is caused by a virus (Dengue Virus) which has got four different types (Type 1,2,3,4). Common name of the disease is ‘break-bone fever’ "(Haddi Tod Bukhar)" because of severe body and joint pains produced.</p>
                        <b>♦ Spread</b>
                        <p>Just like in Malaria, Dengue fever is also spread by bites of mosquitoes. In this case, the mosquitoes are “Aedes” mosquitoes which are very tough and bold mosquitoes and bite even during day time.</p>
                        <p>This disease occurs more frequently in the rainy season and immediately afterwards (July to October) in India.</p>
                        <p>The Dengue virus is present in the blood of the patient suffering from Dengue fever. Whenever an Aedes mosquito bites a patient of Dengue fever, it sucks blood and along with it, the Dengue virus into its body. The virus undergoes further development in the body of the mosquito for a few days. When the virus containing mosquito bites a normal human being, the virus is injected into the person’s body and he/she becomes infected and can develop symptoms of Dengue fever.</p>
                        <b>♦ Incubation Period</b>
                        <p>It means the time between bite of an infected mosquito and appearance of symptoms of dengue fever in the bitten person. Commonly, it is 5-6 days. However it can vary from 3-10 days. </p>
                        <b>♦ Symptoms of the disease</b>
                        <p>Symptoms depend upon the type of Dengue fever. There are three types of Dengue fever-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Classical (Simple) Dengue Fever
                            <li>Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
                            <li>Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)
                        </ol>
                        <p>The classical (Simple) Dengue fever is a self-limiting disease and does not kill. However, the other types (i.e. DHF & DSS) can prove fatal if prompt treatment is not started.</p>

                        <p>It is important to recognise whether Dengue Fever is Simple or DHF or DSS. The following symptoms will help in diagnosis –</p>
                        <u><p>1. Classical (Simple) Dengue Fever :</p></u>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sudden onset of high fever with feeling of chills (“Thandi Lagna”).
                            <li>Severe Headache, Pains in muscles and joints.
                            <li>Pain behind the eyeballs especially on pressing the eyes or on moving the eyeballs.
                            <li>Extreme weakness, loss of appetite, feeling of nausea.
                            <li>Change in taste sensations in mouth.
                            <li>Pain in abdomen by itself or on touching.
                            <li>Mild pain in throat.
                            <li>Patient feels generally depressed and very sick.
                            <li>Rash on the skin : Pinkish red rash appears on the skin in the form of diffuse flushing, mottling or pinhead eruptions on the face, neck and chest. Later on, the rash may become more prominent. The entire duration of Classical Dengue fever lasts for about 5-7 days and the patient recovers.
                        </ul>

                        <u><p>2. Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever – (DHF) –</p></u>
                        <p>It should be suspected if with above mentioned symptoms of Classical (Simple) Dengue Fever, one or more of the following symptoms appear –</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bleeding (haemorrhagic) manifestations : Bleeding from nose, gums, blood in the stools or in vomiting, bleeding spots on the skin which are seen as dark bluish-black, small or large patches. If a health worker carries out a Tourniquet Test, it is positive. Certain laboratory investigations carried out on a blood sample also confirm DHF.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <u><p>3. Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)<p></u>
                        <p>All symptoms as mentioned above in DHF are present plus the patient also develops a condition called ‘shock’. Symptoms of shock in a Dengue Fever case are –</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The person is very restless and the skin feels cold and clammy despite high fever.
                            <li>The person may start losing consciousness.
                            <li>If you examine the pulse rate of the patient, it is weak and rapid. Similarly, blood pressure will be low.
                        </ul>
                        <b><p>♦ Treatment</p></b>
                        <p>
                            If it is classical (simple) Dengue Fever, the patient can be managed at
                            home. As it is a self-limiting disease, the treatment is purely supportive and symptomatic –
                        </p>
                        e.g. –
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep the fever low by giving paracetamol tablet or syrup as per health worker’s advise.
                            <li>Avoid giving Aspirin or Dispirin tablets to the patient
                            <li>If fever is more than 102°F, carry out hydrotherapy to bring down the temperature.
                            <li>Give plenty of fluids water, shikanji etc. to the patient.
                            <li>Continue normal feeding. In fever, the body, infact, requires more food.
                            <li>Allow the patient to rest.
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If any of the symptoms indicative of DHF or DSS develop, rush the
                            patient to the nearest hospital at the earliest where appropriate investigations
                            will be carried out and necessary treatment instituted, e.g., transfusion of
                            fluids or platelets (a kind of blood cells which become low in DHF and
                            DSS). Please remember that every patient does not require blood
                            platelet transfusion.
                        </p>

                        <b><p>♦ Prevention</p></b>

                        <p>
                            1. Mosquitoes breed only in water sources such as stagnant water in
                            drains and ditches, room air coolers, broken bottles, old discarded tyres,
                            containers and similar sources.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Don’t allow water to remain stagnant in and around your house.
                                Fill the ditches. Clean the blocked drains. Empty the room air
                                coolers and flower vases completely atleast once in seven days
                                and let them dry. Dispose off old containers, tins and tyres etc.
                                properly.
                            <li>
                                Keep the water tanks and water containers tightly covered so
                                that the mosquitoes can not enter them and start breeding.
                            <li>
                                Wherever it is not possible to completely drain the water off from
                                room cooler, water tanks etc., it
                                is advised to put about two
                                tablespoons (30 ml.) of petrol or
                                kerosene oil into them for each
                                100 litres of water. This will
                                prevent mosquito breeding.
                                Repeat it every week.
                            <li>
                                You can also put some types of
                                small fish (Gambusia, Lebister)
                                which eat mosquito larvae into
                                these water collections. These fish can be obtained from the local
                                administrative bodies (e.g., Malaria Officer’s office in the area).
                            <li>
                                Wherever possible, practicable and affordable, prevent entry of
                                mosquitoes into the house by keeping wire mesh on windows and
                                doors.
                            <li>
                                Use mosquito repellent sprays, creams, coils, mats or liquids to
                                drive away/ kill the mosquitoes. Use of googal smoke is a good
                                indigenous method for getting rid of mosquitoes.
                            <li>
                                Wear clothes which cover the body as much as possible. This is
                                more relevant in case of children. Nickers and T-shirts are better
                                avoided during the season of Malaria and Dengue fever, i.e., from
                                July to October.
                            <li>
                                Don’t turn away spray workers whenever they come to spray your
                                house. It is in your own interest to get the house sprayed.
                            <li>
                                Use insecticidal sprays in all
                                areas within the house atleast
                                once a week. Don’t forget to spray
                                behind the photo-frames, curtains,
                                calendars; corners of house,
                                stores.
                            <li>
                                Keep the surroundings of your
                                house clean. Don’t litter garbage.
                                Don’t allow wild herbs etc. to
                                grow around your house (atleast
                                in a radius of about 100 metres
                                around your house). They act as
                                hiding and resting places for
                                mosquitoes.
                            <li>
                                Do inform and take help from your
                                local health centre, panchayat or municipality in case you notice
                                abnormal density of mosquitoes or too many cases of fever are
                                occurring in your area.

                            <li>
                                If fencing of the doors and windows is not possible due to any
                                reason, spray the entire house daily with pyrethrum solution.
                            <li>
                                Dengue fever occurs most frequently in India in the months of
                                July to October because this season provides very suitable conditions
                                for breeding of mosquitoes. Hence all these preventive steps must
                                be taken during the season.
                            <li>
                                Lastly, it is advisable to always keep the patient of Dengue fever
                                under a mosquito net in the first 5-6 days of the illness so that
                                mosquitoes don’t have an access to him/her. This will help in
                                reduction in spread of Dengue fever to other persons in the
                                Community.
